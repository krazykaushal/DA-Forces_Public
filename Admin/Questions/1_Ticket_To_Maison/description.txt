Ticket To Maison

Recently You along with your N-1 friends won a trip to EL Dorado. There you all went to a casino and played a game called Ticket to Maison. As EL Dorado is a mysterious land, each one of you are terrified and want to come back to their home(Maison).

In the Game Ticket to Maison, N players are there and Q Rounds are played. After each round players from indices start(S) to end(E), win the round and get P points each. Now to win the Game you need to have the maximum number of points. As the land is mysterious there can be games where there can be more than one player with the maximum number of points. In that case you are required to return the list of all those players. All the winners will get the Ticket to Maison from EL Dorado.

Input:
The first line contains two space-separated integers  N and Q, number of Participants and the number of Rounds.
Each of the next  Q lines contains three space-separated integers start(S), end(E) and P, the left index, right index and Points.

Constraints:
3 <= N <= 10^7
1 <= Q <= 2*10^5
1 <= S <= E <= N
0 <= P <= 10^9

Output:
In the first line, Print the Maximum Points i.e., the points scored by the winner(s). In the second line print the index of the winner(s).

Sample Test Case:
Input:
5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100

Output:
200
2 3 4

Explanation:
N = 5, Q = 3

Round 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Round 1
100, 100, 0, 0, 0
Round 2
100, 200, 100, 100, 100
Round 3
100, 200, 200, 200, 100

So, Maximum Points is 200. And the Lucky Indices are 2, 3, 4 (One based Indexing).
